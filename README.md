#**Kickstarter Crowd Funding Analysis**

##**Overview of Project**

Our client, Louise, is an up and coming playwright that would like to launch a crowdfunding campaign for her play, Fever. Louise has an estimated budget between $10K-12K. 

###**Purpose of Analysis**

As an Excel power user, I will organize, sort and analyze crowd funding data to determine and identify factors that contribute to a project campaign’s success.  This analysis will give Louise an understanding of campaigns from start to finish so she can leverage these insights to plan a successful campaign for her play. 

##**Analysis and Challenges**

*Information at a Glance*

To help Louise view the Kickstarter data quickly, I’ve color coded campaign outcomes and funding percentages. This information can be found on the tab marked Kickstarter and, in the columns, labeled Outcomes and Percent Funded. Failed outcomes are red, successful outcomes are green, canceled projects are yellow and live projects are blue. Projects that were 100 percent funded are shaded in purple, projects exceeding 100 percent are blue and projects less than 100 percent funded are red.  

*U.S. Crowd Funding*

The tab marked Theatre Outcomes shows an overview of U.S. crowd funding theatre projects and is visualized in the chart below.  If more information is desired, the Subcategory Statistics tab shows U.S. specific data for all Kickstarter campaigns. Note: Plays were the most successful projects in general and for the theatre category.

*Establishing Campaign Timelines*

The tab marked Outcomes Based on Launch Date will help Louise plan a successful campaign timeline. The data, visualized below, shows May was the best month to launch a campaign and December had the least success overall. Note: July and October had the most failed campaigns.

*Additional Information* 

Louise was inspired to start her campaign by five plays at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. I analyzed the goals, pledges, average donations and number of backers for each play, which can be found on the tab marked Edinburgh Research.  Each play met and, in some cases, exceeded their goals with average donations above $30. I also compared the goals and pledges of successful and failed U.S. play campaigns to highlight trends. Based on the analysis, Louise may need to cut her budget by half as the average goal for successful campaign $5,600. The pledge range for successful campaigns was $1700- $5,700. As a reference, failed campaigns had an average goal of $10,500 and had pledges ranging $9-$500.   

###*Challenges*

The dataset was stored in 14 columns and 4115 rows since it contained data from all Kickstarter campaigns, not just plays or theatre projects. To make the worksheet more user-friendly, I added filters to display the data I wanted to focus on and created columns for the Parent Category and Subcategory to further focus the analysis. 

##**Results**

According to the Theater Outcomes By Launch Date data, most theater campaigns were launched in May, which also has the highest number of failed campaigns. December has the fewest launched campaigns and January has the highest number of canceled campaigns.   As shown in the following chart, the data suggests May and June launches for Plays and Theatre projects are factors in success.

As mentioned above and confirmed by the Outcomes Based on Goals data, campaigns with a goal between $1,000- $4,999 have a 73% success rate.  Louise’s goal, $10K-$12K, has a 54% chance of success so she may want to consider adjusting her budget. 

*Items to consider*

It is important to remember lower goals, lead to more projects and higher success rates. Conversely, projects with higher goals have higher failure percentages. According to the Outcomes Based on Goals data, success percentage dips below 50% with goals in the $20,000- $25,000 range and continues to decline. However, there are exceptions in the dataset. Projects with goals between $35,000-$49,999 have a 67% success rate. See chart below or file named Outcomes_vs_Goals in the accompanying Resources folder.

*Further Analysis* 

To learn more about Kickstarter campaign success, I would like to collect data from surveys to explore launch date success and failure. I would also like to chart how long a campaign would need to be to hit Louise’s $10K-$12K so she would not have to drastically cut her budget.
